# Belkin-F9K1122v1-Exploit
Metasploit Module of the Belkin F9K1122v1 Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Exploit with Process Continuation.

This module exploits an anonymous remote code execution vulnerability within the Belkin F9K1221v1 repeater. The vulnerability is due to a failure to check the length of the HTTP POST argument 'webpage' before copying it into a static stack based buffer of 100 bytes via sprintf() as a string based argument (%s).
